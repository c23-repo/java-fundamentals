The basics directory is an introductory lab that has a class of Main and uses three functions. The first function is pluralize to pluralize words dependant on the number of said item. 

The second function it uses is flipNHeads, which randomizes and number and returns the heads or tails if greater than or less than the double of .5 while also counting the number of times it took to get heads x number of times in a row. 

The third function is clock, which prints out the time continuously every second until prompted to quit.
